**Welcome to my _extremely_ important user page**

My name is **Ryan Shamoon**. I am a 3rd year computer science major at UCSD. Some of my favorite hobbies are chess, soccer, and sports gambling. 

## Random Things I Like

One of my favorite and most iconcic quotes is from Obito Uchilla, who says:
> Those who break the rules are scum, but those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.
This is from one of my favorite shows, *Naruto: Shippuden*

My favorite programming language is probably Java. Here is how you write a for loop in Java:
```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```
I enjoy math quite a bit. In fact, when I was young, one site I played on a lot was [Cool Math Games](https://www.coolmathgames.com).
